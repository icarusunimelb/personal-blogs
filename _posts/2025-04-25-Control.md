## Laplace transform
### Laplace transform
\\\[F(s) = L[f(t)] = \int_0^{\inf}f(t)e^{-st}dt\\\], where \\\(s = \sigma+\omega i\\\), i.e., \\\(s\\\) is a complex number. \\\(s\\\) is a complex variable in frequency domain and \\\(t\\\) is a real variable in time domain. 

The inverse Laplace transform is given by the following complex integral:
\\\[f(t)=L^{-1}[F] (t)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\lim_{T\rightarrow \inf}\int_{\gamma-iT}^{\gamma+iT}e^{st}F(s)ds\\\], where \\\(\gamma\\\) is a real number so that the contour path of integration is in the region of convergence of \\\(F(s)\\\). 
The Laplace transform's key property is that it converts differentiation and integration in the time domain into multiplication and division by \\\(s\\\) in the Laplace domain.

The Laplace transform \\\(L[f(t)]\\\) exists if it has expontential order and \\\(\int_0^b|f(t)|dt\\\) exists for any \\\(b>0\\\). OR
The Laplace transform \\\(L[f(t)]\\\) exists if:
1. \\\(f(t)\\\) has expontential order and 
2. on every closed interval \\\([0,b]\\\)
    1. \\\(f(t)\\\) is bounded, 
    2. \\\(f(t)\\\) is piecewise continuous, and
    3. \\\(f(t)\\\) has at most a finite number of discontinuities.

### Properties and theorems
Linearity: 
\\\[L[af(t)+bg(t)] = aL[f(t)]+bL[g(t)]\\\]. 

Derivative:
\\\[L[f^{(n)}(t)] = s^n L(f(t))-\sum_{k=1}^{n}s^{n-k}f^{k-1}(0)\\\].

Integeration:
\\\[L[\int_0^tdt\int_0^tdt...\int_0^tf(t)dt] = \frac{1}{s^n}L[f(t)]\\\]. 
\\\[\int_s^{\inf}L[f(t)]ds = L[\frac{f(t)}{t}]\\\].

Time shifting:
\\\[L[f(t-\tau)u(t-\tau)] = e^{-\tau s}F(s)\\\], where \\\(u(t)\\\) is the Heaviside step function.
\\\[L[e^{at}f(t)]=L[f(t)]\\\]

Convolution:
\\\[L[f(t)*g(t)] = L[f(t)]\cdot L[g(t)]\\\]

## Coding basic control blocks in simulation 
In control system simulations, complex controllers (like PID controllers) are built by connecting simple fundamental blocks. Each block has a specific mathematical behavior and role.

## Gain block
### Concept
A gain block multiplies an input signal by a constant factor (the gain). It scales the amplitude of the signal up or down. 

### Mathematical Equation
If \\\(K\\\) is the gain constant and \\\(x(t)\\\) is the input, then the output \\\(y(t)\\\) is \\\(y(t)=K\cdot x(t)\\\).  There is no differential equation (no dynamics) for a pure gain since itâ€™s an algebraic scaling.

### Transfer Function
In the Laplace domain, a gain is simply \\\(G(s) = K\\\).  This means the output-to-input ratio is \\\(K\\\) for all frequencies (a flat frequency response).

### Role in Control Systems
Gain blocks are ubiquitous in controllers. In a PID controller, the proportional term is essentially a gain block (the proportional gain \\\(K_p\\\) multiplying the error signal). 

### Code implementation
{% highlight ruby %}
def gain_block(yi,p):
    yo = p * yi
    return yo
