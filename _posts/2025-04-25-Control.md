## Laplace transform
\\\(F(s) = L[f(t)] = \int_0^{\inf}f(t)e^{-st}dt\\\), where \\\(s = \sigma+\omega i\\\), i.e., \\\(s\\\) is a complex number. \\\(s\\\) is a complex variable in frequency domain and \\\(t\\\) is a real variable in time domain. 

The inverse Laplace transform is given by the following complex integral:
\\\(f(t)=L^{-1}[F](t)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\lim_{T\rightarrow \inf}\int_{\gamma-iT}^{\gamma+iT}e^{st}F(s)ds\\\), where \\\(\gamma\\\) is a real number so that the contour path of integration is in the region of convergence of \\\(F(s)\\\).
