## Laplace transform
### Laplace transform
\\\(F(s) = L[f(t)] = \int_0^{\inf}f(t)e^{-st}dt\\\), where \\\(s = \sigma+\omega i\\\), i.e., \\\(s\\\) is a complex number. \\\(s\\\) is a complex variable in frequency domain and \\\(t\\\) is a real variable in time domain. 

The inverse Laplace transform is given by the following complex integral:
\\\(f(t)=L^{-1}[F](t)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\lim_{T\rightarrow \inf}\int_{\gamma-iT}^{\gamma+iT}e^{st}F(s)ds\\\), where \\\(\gamma\\\) is a real number so that the contour path of integration is in the region of convergence of \\\(F(s)\\\). 

The Laplace transform's key property is that it converts differentiation and integration in the time domain into multiplication and division by \\\(s\\\) in the Laplace domain.

The Laplace transform \\\(L[f(t)]\\\) exists if it has expontential order and \\\(\int_0^b|f(t)|dt\\\) exists for any \\\(b>0\\\). OR
The Laplace transform \\\(L[f(t)]\\\) exists if:
1. \\\(f(t)\\\) has expontential order and 
2. on every closed interval \\\([0,b]\\\)
    1. \\\(f(t)\\\) is bounded, 
    2. \\\(f(t)\\\) is piecewise continuous, and
    3. \\\(f(t)\\\) has at most a finite number of discontinuities.
