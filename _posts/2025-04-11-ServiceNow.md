## Introduction
ServiceNow is a cloud based platform, which was mainly developed for workflow and process automation as per the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) principles. However, it is highly customisable and also can be used for other purposes. This tutorial will primarily focus on its basic concepts, Developer Mode, NowAssist AI, and Strategic Portfolio Management modules.

## ITIL
ITIL is a library of best practices that are employed in IT service management (ITSM)â€”the practice of planning, implementing, managing and optimizing information technology services to meet the needs of users and help organizations achieve their business goals.

ITIL can be divided into five main stages, including **Service Strategy**, **Service Design**, **Service Transition**, **Service Operation**, and **Continual Service Improvement**. Every stage has a specific role to play in a service life cycle and form the skeleton of ITIL. For the details, please check <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/servicenow/servicenow_itil.htm"> Ref. [1] </a>. 

The lastest ITIL edition, ITIL 4 consists of 34 practices that are grouped into 3 main categories: 1. **General management practices**, 2. **Service management practices**, and 3. **Technical management practices**. For the details, please check <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/it-infrastructure-library#:~:text=ITIL%20stands%20for%20Information%20Technology,practices%20in%20IT%20service%20management"> Ref. [3] </a>. 

The benefits of ITIL are as follows:
* Stronger alignment between IT and business strategy
* Improved customer satisfaction and service delivery
* Increased transparency and visibility into IT processes and services
* Budgeting guidance
* Reduced IT costs
* Enhanced communication within teams and across stakeholders

## Cloud
Here we briefly introduce cloud service models, which are categorised based on the services offered by the cloud service providers.
* **Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)**. This is the most fundamental level of cloud service, where in customer only takes computing resources or virtual hardware like storage, CPU, RAM, etc. from the cloud service providers.
* **Platform as a service (PaaS)**. This is one level further to IaaS. Here, along with the computing resources/virtual hardware, operating system, some software service and tools are also provided by the cloud service providers.
* **Software as a service (SaaS)**. This service model offers fully functional, ready to use software over the internet.

ServiceNow is a highly flexible application which provides the option of PaaS as well as SaaS. Its SaaS offering provides fully functional workflow automation and ITSM tools, while its PaaS offering, allows the user to develop a custom application on the top of existing suite, as per the business requirement.
